//
// Seeds the 33 Sri Lanka spot-fine offences into the `offenses` collection.
// Source: Motor Traffic Act — Gazette Extraordinary No. 2054/9 (15 January 2018).
//
// Demerit weights (out of DEMERIT.DEFAULT_POINTS = 24):
//   2 = MINOR     — paperwork / equipment / minor nuisance
//   4 = MODERATE  — unsafe practice, risk to occupants or other road users
//   6 = SERIOUS   — directly dangerous driving behaviour
//   8 = CRITICAL  — high risk of serious injury / loss of life
//
// Usage:
//   npm run seed:offenses                 -> upsert the 33 offences and hide old non-spot-fine offences
//   npm run seed:offenses -- --keep-legacy -> upsert only, leave old offences visible in the dropdown
//
// Safe to run multiple times (upsert by offenseCode). Old offences are never deleted,
// so issued fines that reference them keep working.
